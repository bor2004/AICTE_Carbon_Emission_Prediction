# **Prediction of CO2 emissions from country-specific data**
***

## Problem Statement:

Analysis of country-specific data and development of machine learning models in order to predict CO2 emissions from country parameters. The project uses the publicly available dataset Climate Change Data from the World Bank Group, which provides data on the vast majority of countries over a range of years for parameters such as:

* country: the vast majority of countries worldwide
* year: ranging from 1990 to 2011
* various emissions of greenhouse gases such as CO2, CH4, N2O, others
* population-specific parameters: population count, urban population, population growth, etc.
* country economic indicators: GDP, GNI, Foreign Direct Investment, etc.
* land-related parameters: cereal yield, agricultural land, Nationally terrestrial protected areas, etc.
* climate data: precipitations, national disasters, etc.
* energy use
* counts of certain types of medical personnel
* etc.

The project is divided into two stages:

1. Data cleaning and preparation
2. Data exploration and Predictive analysis

Each of the stages is described in a separate Jupyter Notebook(.ipynp file) and a derived pdf file.

### Project Goals

This machine learning project begins with a high-level analysis of the dataset to define initial goals, which will evolve as deeper insights emerge. Early goal-setting guides data cleaning, transformation, and visualization.

The dataset includes country-level features across:

- Greenhouse gas emissions (CO₂, CH₄, N₂O, etc.)
- Demographics (population size, urbanization, growth)
- Economy (GDP, GNI, FDI)
- Land use (cereal yield, protected areas)
- Climate data (precipitation, disasters)
- Energy consumption
- Health infrastructure
- Others

**Initial Objective:**  
To analyze the relationships between these features and their impact on climate indicators like emissions and precipitation. Ultimately, the goal is to develop an ML model to predict climate-related variables using country-specific parameters.

These goals will be refined as the project progresses.
